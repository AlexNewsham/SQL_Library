- Calendar_Dates_Time
  Provides working examples of how to:
  - Create a data frame of dates and where they fall withing successive academic years
  - Generate a list or persistent table of all dates that fall within a given date range,
    providing the Year, Month, named day of the week, and the numeric week of the year         within which the date falls.

- Loops: Example of loops (mostly in) TSQL that show how SQL-scripted loops can be used to iterate through data, run asynchronous transactions, and build output 

- ID_Generation: Provides working examples of how to generate your own sets of identifiers. Calculating and adding a check digit to your IDs using the Lunh algorithm enables you to validate IDs during data capture and mitigate keying errors.
