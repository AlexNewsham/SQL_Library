# SQL_Library

A library of exempla SQL coded scripts for re-use and adaptation

Folders:

- Loops: Example of loops (mostly in) TSQL that show how SQL-scripted loops can be used to iterate through data, run asynchronous transactions, and build output 

- ID_Generation: Provides working examples of how to generate your own sets of identifiers. Calculating and adding a check digit to your IDs using the Lunh algorithm enables you to validate IDs during data capture and mitigate keying errors.
